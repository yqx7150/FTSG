## Abstract
Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) imaging is a non-invasive quantitative detection technique that locates and quantifies fluorescent molecular probes in biological tissue. However, due to the light scattering effect and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, it is difficult to accurately reconstruct the fluorescence distribution. Traditional iterative reconstruction methods rely on the selection of regularization parameters, and data-driven deep learning methods have insufficient interpretability. In order to improve the imaging quality, fluorescence molecular tomography via score-based generative model (FTSG) is proposed. Prior information about the fluorescence target distribution is extracted via score-based generative model, which is used as a regularization term constraint for an iterative process based on the physical model. FTSG is validated through simulations and experiments using fluorescent targets with different radii and edge-to-edge distances. Compared with traditional methods, FTSG offers better resolution and reconstruction quality. This method can effectively distinguish two fluorescent targets with an edge-to-edge distance of 1 mm.
